# ErrselaPie

A simple Python Code to control the robot ERRSELA. In the errpy file, you can find the functions used to interact with errsela. Errpy-interactive contains code for an interactive command-line utility for ERRSELA. The err_code file is just me getting my feet wet and seeing what I can do with the errpy functions. You can look in it to see how I like to code the errsela commands, and also how each function constantly pipes the errsela object into the next.
